                         THE SBA PROJECT 
The following are the step-by-step process I took to complete this project.

                       First of all I created a folder named SBA on my desktop. I went  ahead to open my SBA Project folder in my virtual studio code. On the next step, I  created a new repository and named Version-control-simulation-RE  and clone the repository on my visual studio code under the SBA Project folder, I therefore CD into my version control simulation– RE repository and created an index.html file with a simple html code structure.I check the status, added and committed the structure with Git commands.
                      After, I then checked out and created a branch called feature/header. I added a header structure code to the index.html file. Using Git commands like (git add., and commit) to make sure branch code structure is saved on my feature/header branch, I checked the status and confirmed that it is on a feature branch and not on the main  branch. I therefore  checkout to the main branch again. I checked out the origin main and created another branch file called feature/footer, added a footer code structure and committed the footer branch and I checked back to the main folder again. 
                      At this stage , I merged the feature/header branch file into main successfully. I issued a git command to merge the feature/footer branch  into the main branch and in the process pointed out a conflict  trying to merge into main. And  option was given and I chose to accept both on the same file.the conflict was resolved and both branches where accepted. I  committed after merging these branches  and pushed it into my repository on Github and verified it.
                    On the second project after the push to the origin Main, I created a pool request after using the command get pull origin main I created a new branch which called review/main. I therefore added navigation code structure into the index.html file. Did a git  add. and committed it to create a new branch from the main. I then push the new branch into the repository. Comparing the main and review/main i added a descriptive note and how  and steps made the changes in the code structure and emphasize on the importance in a review was made and peer gave a comment “look nice” in the comment section look  picture attached for verification.
